# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome patches to this project, as long as you follow these
guidelines:

## Indentation and whitespace

2-space, soft-tabs only. No trailing whitespace.

## Versioning

Follow the guidelines on [semver.org](http://semver.org/) for assigning version
numbers.

Versions should only be changed in a commit of their own, in a pull request of
their own. This alerts team members to the new version and allows for
last-minute scrutiny before the new version is released. Also, by raising a
separate pull request, we avoid version number conflicts between feature
branches.
